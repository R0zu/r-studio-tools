If you want to jump straight to getting something done, follow this compact guide. The Releases page contains ready-to-run packages for major platforms. From the releases, download the appropriate installer or archive for your system, then run or extract it to begin recovery tasks.

- Locate the release package that matches your environment.
- On Windows, run the installer executable after downloading.
- On macOS, open the disk image or installer package and follow the prompts.
- On Linux, extract the tarball or run the installer script as described in the release notes.
- Launch the tool and start a scan to identify recoverable data. The interface guides you through selecting a source drive, analyzing the RAID configuration, and outlining recoverable items.

Note: The download link above points to the official Releases page. If you run into trouble accessing the link, visit the Releases section of the repository to obtain the assets manually.

Core ideas and workflow
Data recovery is a careful process. The tools in this project are designed to minimize risk while maximizing the chance of salvaging files. The recovery workflow typically follows these steps:

- Identify the source: you choose a disk, a disk image, or a RAID member.
- Analyze the structure: check file systems, partition tables, and RAID metadata.
- Assess health: review S.M.A.R.T. data, read errors, and potential media degradation.
- Reconstruct and recover: for RAID arrays, reconstruct parity and rebuild the array if needed.
- Validate and export: verify recovered files, integrity, and target locations.

The philosophy here is to give you clear options, keep risk low, and document each action. You can mix guided flows with manual tweaks to handle unusual cases. The tools emphasize transparency about what is being scanned, what is being recovered, and where the recovered data will live.

What you get
- Disk and image analysis: quick scans to map partitions, file systems, and RAID metadata.
- RAID recovery support: parity-based rebuilds for common RAID configurations, degraded array handling, and rebuild verification.
- Network RAID support: diagnoses for NAS devices using Network RAID schemes, with options to extract data across network shares.
- Data integrity checks: checksums, hash verifications, and consistency tests to ensure recovered data is valid.
- Export and reporting: options to export recovered files, generate reports, and log activities for auditing.
- Safe operation modes: non-destructive analysis prior to irreversible actions, with clear prompts for destructive steps.
- Cross-platform compatibility: designed to work on Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.

Emojis guide you through concepts in a friendly way, while the tools behind the scenes handle complex analyses. The goal is to provide practical outcomes without sacrificing clarity or control.

Supported platforms and requirements
- Windows: 10 and later, 64-bit builds. Requires standard admin rights to install and run recovery operations.
- macOS: macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) and newer, 64-bit. Gatekeeper considerations may apply for unsigned installers; follow on-screen prompts to allow the app to run.
- Linux: Modern distributions with glibc and common development tools. Use the provided tarballs or installer where available.
- Hardware considerations: a stable primary system with enough free space to hold recovered data, and a separate target drive for exports when possible. For RAID and Network RAID tasks, a reliable network connection helps, and enough RAM improves scanning performance.

If you need to check the health of storage devices before attempting recovery, look for SMART data and SMART-enabled tools. The project favors safe defaults and clear prompts for any potentially destructive action. The aim is to protect your data while giving you the means to recover as much as possible.

How to install and run
1) Download the appropriate package from the Releases page for your platform. The link has a path part, so that file needs to be downloaded and executed. After the download completes, proceed to run the installer (Windows), open the disk image or installer (macOS), or extract and run the binary (Linux).

2) On first run, the application will guide you through initial setup. This includes choosing a data export location, configuring network access if you plan to work with NAS or Network RAID, and selecting preferred language and UI options.

3) Start with a quick scan. Pick a source drive, disk image, or RAID member. The scan will reveal partitions, file systems, and potential recoverable data. You can inspect the results in the built-in pane and filter by file type or folder.

4) For RAID recovery, identify the RAID level if possible. The tool will propose parity-based recovery paths when needed and show you degraded array options if a member is missing.

5) Recover to a safe location. Always export recovered data to a different drive from the source to minimize risk of data corruption or overwriting.

6) Validate the results. Use the integrity checks to confirm that recovered files are intact and usable. If you still have questions, consult the tutorials, manuals, and community resources.

7) Save reports. The system can generate a recovery report detailing steps performed, the data recovered, and any issues encountered. These reports can help with audits and future planning.

Remember, if the link to the releases fails, check the Releases section for assets and instructions. You can still access the same downloads via the repository's Releases hub to obtain the latest builds.

Visual assets and design
The project uses a clean, readable UI with clear icons for disks, RAID components, and network devices. Visual elements emphasize safety and progress indicators. The color palette favors blue and gray tones to convey trust and stability, with orange accents to highlight warnings or critical actions.

- Icons: Disk drives, RAID arrays, and network devices use consistent glyphs to reduce cognitive load during recovery tasks.
- Progress indicators: Real-time feedback on scans, rebuilds, and exports helps you gauge progress at a glance.
- Layout: A stable left-hand navigation and a dominant center workspace allow you to focus on the data and recovery results.

Imagery
Images reflect the storage and RAID landscape. You may see depictions of disk shelves, RAID consoles, NAS devices, and data streams. Where applicable, the documentation and tutorials use annotated diagrams to illustrate recovery workflows.

If you want to explore real-world recovery scenarios, browse the tutorials and case studies in the Documentation section. The examples cover drive failures, degraded RAID arrays, and Network RAID challenges with practical steps you can follow.

Usage scenarios and examples
- Single-disk failure recovery: A user identifies a failed drive and uses the scanning feature to locate recoverable partitions. The tool suggests file-level or sector-level recovery options and allows exporting to a safe location.
- RAID-5 with degraded member: The system detects a missing member, analyzes parity, and guides you through a parity rebuild. After a successful rebuild, you can recover the missing files and verify integrity.
- RAID-6 multi-disk failure: In more complex failure scenarios, the tool leverages robust parity models to reconstruct data. Care is taken to minimize the risk of further data loss during the rebuild process.
- Network RAID recovery: A NAS device presents a Network RAID layout. The recovery workflow includes mapping shares, accessing the array configuration, and extracting recoverable data across the network with appropriate authentication.
- Corrupted file systems: For corrupted partitions, the tool can mount read-only images, extract intact files, and offer file repair options for damaged metadata.

CLI and scripting basics
If you prefer automation, the project exposes a command-line interface (CLI) to perform common tasks. CLI usage can speed up repetitive recovery operations or be embedded into scripts for larger data workflows.

- Scan: scan --source /dev/sdb or scan --image backup.img
- Inspect: inspect --part 1 --detail
- Rebuild: raid-rebuild --raid /dev/md0 --degraded
- Export: export --destination /mnt/recover --files "*.docx, *.xlsx"
- Validate: validate --hashes checksums.txt
- Log: log --level info --output recover.log

A few tips for scripting
- Use non-destructive options by default. If you need to perform destructive actions, confirm prompts or pass explicit flags to bypass prompts.
- Log all operations. Keep logs for audits and troubleshooting.
- Test on non-critical data first. Before aggressive recovery runs, verify the process with small datasets.

Scripting enables repeatable recovery pipelines. You can integrate the CLI into your batch processes, automation servers, or custom dashboards. If you have a large set of drives to process, a simple script can scan each device, try a best-effort recovery, and report outcomes in a centralized log.

Scenarios and best practices
- Work on an image when possible. If you can create a forensic disk image, run scans and recover from the image to avoid touching the original drive.
- Maintain a clean export path. Dedicate a separate drive or partition for recovered data to minimize the risk of overwriting live data.
- Validate as you go. Use checksums or hash comparisons to verify recovered files, especially for important documents and irreplaceable media.
- Document your steps. Keep notes of the drives involved, the RAID configurations encountered, and the actions taken. This helps with future recovery attempts and audits.
- Plan for partial recoveries. In many cases you recover a subset of data rather than everything. Prioritize user-critical folders or file types first.

Data safety and best practices
- Always back up the source before performing any destructive operations.
- Use read-only scans when possible to avoid modifying data unintentionally.
- Prefer exporting to a different disk than the source during recovery.
- Keep your software up to date with the latest security and feature updates from the Releases page.
- If you work with sensitive information, configure access controls and file permissions on recovered data.

Troubleshooting and common issues
- No accessible disks: Confirm that the drives are physically connected and recognized by the OS. Check cables, power, and BIOS/UEFI settings.
- RAID metadata not detected: Some drives may not expose metadata in a standard format. Try manual RAID level selection or use a disk image to reason about parity patterns.
- Rebuild failures: If parity reconstruction fails, verify that the correct drives are included and that there is no data corruption on the surviving members.
- Network RAID access errors: Ensure proper network credentials and permissions. Check firewall rules and share accessibility.
